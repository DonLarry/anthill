Runtimes
========

This document refers to various Runtimes (or SDK's) that handle the technical issues under the hood,
and provide convenient high-level API for solving design issues.

Despite being written in different languages, they follow same API design, so this section will describe Runtimes in
language-agnostic way, with language-specific examples on each particular call.
