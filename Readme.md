# Anthill Platform

An open source back-end platform for games that solves the online problem.

* **Self-hosted**. You have full control over the system. That makes it cheaper to maintain and a lot easier to modify.
* **Open Source**. Under MIT License, actively maintained, with no black box stuff inside.
* **Scalable**. Each service is easily scalable since the whole system works like an anthill itself: add more workers into it and they will do the job.
* **Easy to customise**. It can hold any type of game, because it’s designed to be as much abstract as possible. The way it acts is completely up to the game.
* **Unified**. Each service follows standards so its behaviour is predictable. Implement few interfaces and your new service is ready to be plugged in!
* **A platform**. Not just a complete solution, it’s a platform. If there is no service that meets your exact requirements, you can easily create a new one!
